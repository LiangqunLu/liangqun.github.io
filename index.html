<p>
As an interdisciplinary field, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics and mathematics to analyze and interpret biological data. With the advantage of next-generation sequencing technologies, bioinformatics has improved the research in complex genetic diseases, especially in cancer research. Biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis and metastasis have been used in clinical to improve patient outcomes. Data integration techniques have been utilized to develop a systematic interpretation of genotype and phenotype in cancer. Statistical approaches and mathematical modelings have been developed to interrogate the evolutionary dynamics of tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. As the 2nd leading cause of death in the world, I believe that our research is not fast enough at providing treatment to cancer patients, although progresses have been made these days. In my family, two aunts suffered from thyroid and uterine carcinoma and one cousin was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Although timely surgery removed the cancer tissues, I worry about the survival and possible tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. In the context of precision medicine, I want to contribute to the understanding of tumorigenesis and progression as well as the development of therapeutics through statistical inference and omic data analysis as a bioinformatician.
